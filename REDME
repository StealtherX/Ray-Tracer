Ray Tracer by Kevin Jacobs

This program uses ray tracing to render a scene of spheres and infinite planes. It only uses OpenGL to render a buffer of pixels to the screen. Use the included data.3d file to render a sample scene.

System Requirements:

    Tested on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04
    Graphics card with OpenGL
    QT SDK
    GLUT

Compile using QT Creator and then run the executable.
